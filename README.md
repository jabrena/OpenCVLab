### Rubik Solver with OpenCV.

This project tries to solve the Rubik's cube problem using Computer Vision. This problem is nice way to use OpenCV with EV3. The architecture is:

- **Client:** A EV3 brick with a Webcam stream image frames. (LeJOS 0.8.2)
- **Server:** A PC running a Java Program process images streamed by the EV3 and process them using [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv), Java interface to [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).
