# OpenCV Lab

OpenCV Lab is a public repo to explore the usage of OpenCV with Robots.

## EV3 Projects:

### Rubik Solver with OpenCV.

#### Description:
This project tries to solve the Rubik's cube problem using Computer Vision. This problem is nice way to use OpenCV with EV3. The architecture is:

- **Client:** A EV3 brick with a Webcam stream image frames. (LeJOS 0.8.2)
- **Server:** A PC running a Java Program process images streamed by the EV3 and process them using [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv), Java interface to [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).

#### Benefits

Developing this project, we will learn:

- Usage of Git
- Install LeJOS Developer Snapshot
- How to stream images with Java
- How to process images with OpenCV
